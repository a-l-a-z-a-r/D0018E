# D0018E Lab Assignment: An Internet E-commerce Site

## Overview

The objective of this assignment is to approach an SQL database by building a small e-commerce site, accessed by standard web browser clients. The task includes setting up and managing a database on a server and building a basic web frontend. The SQL database schema will store data handled by the website.

The course focuses on database design and application programming, so the core effort should be on database functionality, with the web page requiring only a basic layout. The solution should be designed to run on a web hotel or cloud platform, although for this lab, it can be hosted on your server.

The result of this lab will become part of your portfolio, showcasing your demo-friendly work for job applications.

## Working Methods

### Guidelines
- **Teamwork**: Build your solution in teams of 2-3 students. Ensure everyone participates hands-on. Assign yourselves to groups in Canvas.
- **Collaboration**: Teams should build their own solutions but can collaborate across teams. Use the Canvas chat to ask questions, share links, or help others.
- **Research**: Search for and reuse knowledge, software, and resources from the web. Make proper references in your report.

### Reporting
- **Collaboration**: List the people and teams you worked with and reference external resources. Use two levels of references:
  - **Important**: Heavily used resources.
  - **Informal**: Lightly used resources.
- **Agile Development**:
  - **User Stories/Roles**: Define scenarios, actions, requirements, and functions for each role.
  - **Backlog**: Maintain a prioritized backlog with ID, description, priority, effort (small/medium/large), sprint number, and status.
  - **Small Sprints**: Develop in small steps with demos for each sprint.
  - **Test-Driven Development**: Define and reuse test cases early.
- **Documentation**:
  - Executive summary.
  - User stories, use cases, and requirements.
  - System architecture and implementation overview.
  - Current backlog.
  - Database schema (E-R diagram, key descriptions).
  - Test case specifications.
  - System limitations and improvement opportunities.

## Steps

### Step 1: Establish a Minimalistic Website
1. **Setup Development Environment**:
   - Choose an IDE (e.g., VS Code, JetBrains, Eclipse) and set up your development environment.
   - Set up your server in the cloud or on your PC using a hypervisor (e.g., VirtualBox).
2. **Web Page Setup**:
   - Create a simple webpage to serve as a foundation.
   - Use a relational database.
3. **Database Familiarity**:
   - Use MySQL Workbench or a similar tool to visualize and manage your database schema.
4. **Basic Functionality**:
   - Create simple database tables and a web interface to access/modify data.
5. **Report**:
   - Document selections and provide a demo.

### Step 2: Establish a Relational Database for E-commerce
1. **Database Design**:
   - Define use cases, requirements, and data.
   - Include tables for Assets, Customers, and Orders with a variable like stock counters.
2. **Documentation**:
   - Create and update documentation.
3. **Front-End**:
   - List assets, place orders, and implement customer accounts if needed.
4. **Report**:
   - Update the report and provide a demo link.

### Step 3: Add Shopping Basket
1. **Basket Functionality**:
   - Add and remove assets from the basket and implement checkout for multiple assets.
2. **Concurrency Testing**:
   - Test for performance under load.
3. **Report**:
   - Explain implementation and challenges, and provide a demo link.

### Step 4: Add Grading and Comments
1. **Customer Feedback**:
   - Implement grading and comments for assets.
   - Optionally, structure comments (e.g., as a tree).
2. **Documentation**:
   - Update the report with implementation details and challenges.

### Step 5: Additional Functions
1. **Personalization**:
   - Add extra features to make your e-commerce site unique.

## Final Report and Portfolio
The final report should include:
1. **Executive Summary**: Introduce the project and its purpose.
2. **Core Content**:
   - User stories, use cases, requirements.
   - System architecture and implementation overview.
   - Database schema (E-R diagram, key descriptions).
   - Links to code and demo.
   - Test cases.
   - Limitations and improvements.
3. **Appendix**: Chronological development history if needed.

The final report, code, and demo will contribute to your professional portfolio.
